# Getting Started With Elixir and Phoenix

## Elixir
Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications.
Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems, while also being successfully used in web development and the embedded software domain.

 ``` brew install elixir ``` in the terminal to install Elixir

```iex``` to enter 'interactive elixir'. This allows you to run elixir expressions in the terminal.

# Elixir

## Basic Types

Syntax
```Elixir
iex> 1          # integer
iex> 0x1F       # integer
iex> 1.0        # float
iex> true       # boolean
iex> :atom      # atom / symbol
iex> "elixir"   # string
iex> [1, 2, 3]  # list
iex> {1, 2, 3}  # tuple
```

## Simple Calculator
To create a calculator in Elixir you will first need to create a file with the extension '*.ex'.
    ```calculator.ex```
First we need to define our module which can be done with:
    ```Elixir
    defmodule Calc do

    end
    ````
Inside of our module we can right all of our different math methods. For instance for addition you would do:
    ```Elixir
    defmodule Calc do
        def add(a, b) do
            val = a + b
            IO.puts val
        end
    end
    ```
    
In order to compile the code so that you can run it from the terminal you need to enter:
``` elixirc calculator.ex```
This will create a file called Elixir.Calc.beam. The middle word Calc is the name of the module that you defined inside the file.
For instance 'defmoudle Calc'
Calculator
```Elixir
defmodule Calc do
    def add(a, b) do
        val = a + b
       IO.puts val
        val
    end

    def sub(a, b) do
        val = a - b
        IO.puts val
    end

    def multi(a, b) do
        val = a * b
        IO.puts val
    end

    def div(a, b) do
        val = a / b
        IO.puts val
    end
    
end
```

## Phoenix

## Installation
Install all Dependencies by running the following in the command line:

### Elixir
(this command installs elixir and erlang)
``` brew install elixir```

### Hex
```mix local.hex```

### Phoenix
```mix archive.install https://github.com/phoenixframework/archives/raw/master/phx_new.ez```

## Creating a Phoenix Web App
Create the app by running 
```mix phx.new [app name]``` 

Then run `cd [app name]` and configure the database in config/dev.exs by running `mix ecto.create`. (you may have to run `createuser -s -r postgres` for this to work) 

The app can be run with the command 
```mix phx.server``` 
or inside interactive elixir with 
```iex -S mix phx.server```
